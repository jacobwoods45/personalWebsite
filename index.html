                <h1>Atom-Clock</h1>
                <p>Atom-Clock Uses The p5.js library to visualize time using the time functions within the library. The inner cube represents the month, the pink ring represents seconds, and the the outer rings represent the hours, days, and season. If you refresh at different times in the year or different times in the day it will change based upon the returned date and time. It is o GitHub and is hosted through Netlify.</p>

                <h1>Tip Calculator</h1>
                <p>Simple tip calculator uses plain JS and is me working on DOM manipulation. It takes in the total, tax percent, and the amount of people. It outputs the split bill, total tip, and the split tip as well. My goal was to make this as responsive as possible in order to easily access the website on a mobile device.</p>

                <h1>Simple Weather App - Springfield</h1>
                <p>his website uses the Open Weather API to retrieve real-time weather data for the city of Springfield, Missouri. It displays things that I might need to know like if I need a jacket, if itâ€™s raining, cloudy, or clear, as well as the windspeed. This idea was inspired from the overly complicated weather applications that I use on my phone and a goal to make it a quick glance web page. </p>
